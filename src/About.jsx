              Hello, I'm <font color="orange">`Gauri Tawale`</font>, a passionate
              Front End developer with a deep love for frontend technologies. I
              also gain knowledge about backend technologies. Through dedicated
              learning and hands-on experience, I can develop my skills and
              transform my passion into a career.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have completed my Post Graduation in{" "}
              <font color="blue">`Government Polytechnic in Ahmednagar`</font>{" "}
              and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
              <br />
              <br />
              Currently, I am a BE student and gaining knowledge about languages
              in Computer Science.

                <br />
                Now I am learning about{" "}
                <font color="green">`Python`</font> in backend technologies and
                gaining knowledge about that language most efficiently. During
                my course at{" "}
                <font color="red">`A2Z Infotech & A2Z IT Hub Private Ltd.`</font>{" "}
                I had the opportunity to develop myself in real-world projects,
                gaining the most knowledge about computer languages. This
                experience not only satisfied my technical career but also
                helped me become better at what I do and understand the IT
                industry.
